## ðŸ”¥ 2 Game Types ðŸ”¥

### Original Mode
In this game mode the game starts when the 'Start Game' button is clicked on the game menu. R2-D2 and Obi Wan Kenobi are both randomly placed on the game board.<br>
You have the option rotate left and right and also move. You control the X in move(x) by changing the number of spaces R2-D2 is to move on the left hand side of the game control panel.<br>
The location and position of both R2-D2 are shown by default on the right hand side of the game board and can be toggled on and off by clicking the radar icon.

### Force Mode ðŸ™Œ
This game is an extension and slight modification of the original mode game-type. In this version of the game R2-D2 can look and move in any direction.<br>
You may also control the movement of R2-D2 with the arrow keys on your keyboard.<br>
